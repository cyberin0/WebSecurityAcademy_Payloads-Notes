If the application implements no defenses against directory traversal attacks, so an attacker can request the following URL to retrieve an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem:
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd

Absolute path bypass:
You might be able to use nested traversal sequences, such as ....// or ....\/, which will revert to simple traversal sequences when the inner sequence is stripped. 

Superfluous character stripping: 
In some contexts, such as in a URL path or the filename parameter of a multipart/form-data request, web servers may strip any directory traversal sequences before passing your input to the application. You can sometimes bypass this kind of sanitization by URL encoding, or even double URL encoding, the ../ characters, resulting in %2e%2e%2f or %252e%252e%252f respectively. Various non-standard encodings, such as ..%c0%af or ..%ef%bc%8f, may also do the trick. 


validation of start path: 
filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd

null byte bypass:
filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png
